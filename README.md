# Simple Python Input Program

## 📖 Description
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that takes the user's name as input and prints a short greeting.  
It is one of my first Python practice programs.

## 💻 Code Example
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
day = "Friday,"
date = "12th September 2025"
program = "Python Programming"
greeting = "Have a nice day!"

print(f"Assalamualaikum! {name}, today is {day} {date}. Welcome to {program}. {greeting}")
```

▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.


2. Save the code in a file named simple.py.


3. Open terminal/command prompt in the same folder.


4. Run the program:

python simple.py


5. Enter your name when prompted.



📌 Example Output
